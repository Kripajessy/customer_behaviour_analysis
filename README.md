# 📊 Data Analytics Project: End-to-End Business Insights

## 📌 Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analytics workflow, starting from raw data ingestion to business insights delivery through dashboards and presentations.
It covers data loading, exploratory data analysis (EDA), data cleaning, SQL analysis, visualization, and reporting, reflecting real-world analytics practices.

The goal is to extract meaningful insights and present them clearly for data-driven decision-making.



## 📁 Dataset

* Source: CSV dataset (business/customer/sales data)
* Size: Medium-scale structured dataset
* Key features include:

  * Customer and demographic details
